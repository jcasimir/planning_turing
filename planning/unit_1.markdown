I have not scheduled a focus week, because I think that reworking this
turns weeks 1-4 pretty much into focus weeks.

Microblogger, EventManager, Encryptor can all be used to keep the fast
students occupied/interested.

We can extract little pieces of encryptor and event reporter to create
fundamentals exercises out of context.
