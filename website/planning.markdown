## Audience

The website serves two primary audiences:

* Potential students (quick visit)
* Future students (long visit)
* Hiring companies

In the past, we've been successful with direct communication to hiring partners, so there isn't a big need on the website. We've also got 10 months until our first students graduate.

Before then, we need to recruit approximately 800 applicants. The website thus has to focus on potential students. They're coming to the website while they're thinking about applying. They have a few shallow, concrete questions but are mostly looking at the feel.

Future students visit the site as they're in or have completed the application process. They're looking for the deep details as they plan a new life. Depth is more important for them anything else. They'll read a 10-page FAQ.

For now we need to focus on the Ruby class, but want the site to grow to support iOS and other classes in the future.

## Voice

Our program is serious -- positioned as the most legitimate learning experience among a crowd of competitors. Past results support this claim.

The voice of the website must balance a bit of gravity with approchability.

## Purpose

Potential students come to the website to answer questions:

### Abstract

* Is this for people like me?
* Can I succeed?

### Concrete

* How much does it cost?
* When do I have to pay?
* Can I do it part-time?
* How long does it take?
* Is it hard to get in?
* When do classes start?
* Will I really find a job?

## Methods

We'll establish the voice of the organization through:

* The logo and branding that add gravity
* Light and clean design that says "modern"
* Copy that's clear and direct, based on transparent data rather than hype
* Alumnus photos and snippets that add approachability
* Video that tells the story

### Front Page

#### Combative / Apirational

Turing builds professional developers. 

We teach languages and frameworks, but we focus on the fundamentals that apply to any language. We strive for a balance between learning the practical details of everyday development with the theoretical details of algorithms, data structures, and writing great code.

#### Student Community

We've learned that peer collaboration and mentorship is more valuable than any instruction we can provide, so Turing is built on community.

Our Web Development program is comprised of four 6-week classes with a one-week intermission between each. Every seven weeks a new group of students begins the program so, by late 2014, four classes will run concurrently creating a community of over one hundred students in the building.

### Results

The team behind Turing created Hungry Academy in 2012 then gSchool in 2013. Turing is our third iteration, building on the curriculum and lessons learned in the previous courses.

From over a thousand applicants we've selected and trained 72 students. All 72 have found full-time employment as developers at companies including:

* LivingSocial
* Pivotal Labs
* Quick Left
* iTriage
* TurboVote
* CardFlight
* Bonobos
* Zen Payroll
* EverFi
* TableXI
* Maui NY
* Thoughtworks
* BrightWhistle
* 24tru
* Comverge
* Big Nerd Ranch
* Tack Mobile
* thoughtbot
